ImageTextCaption
================

ProcessWire module for automatically creating image captions from the image description field and displayed when an image is inserted in a RTE field.


##Usage

All you need to do is enter the caption in the main description field for the image. Note that this is the field attached to the image in the image field, rather than the description field that is added when inserting an image in a RTE field.


##How to install

Download and place the module folder named "ImageTextCaption" in: /site/modules/

In the admin control panel, go to Modules. At the bottom of the screen, click the "Check for New Modules" button.

Now scroll to the ImageTextCaption module and click "Install".
